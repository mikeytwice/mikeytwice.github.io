abstract: Abstract This article examines the devotion to souls in São Paulo—a practice
  that involves lighting candles for and petitioning the souls of the anonymous, suffering
  dead—by focusing on the particularity of place. To that end, it employs the notion
  of religious transit (trânsito religioso), used by Brazilian scholars to talk about
  religious change and movement. But whereas most literature on the subject has focused
  on switching affiliation, this article explores how affect shapes devotees’ religious
  transit through urban space. It argues that, in the context of the devotion, mutual
  suffering underpins a relationship of mutual aid, drawing together the living and
  departed at places of trauma and death.
