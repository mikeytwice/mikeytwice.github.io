abstract: Until recently, Islam in Latin America has eluded sustained scholarly attention.
  This is partly because the Muslim population in Latin America has never been numerically
  large. Even today, following a century of Middle Eastern migration, Muslims comprise
  less than half of one percent of the region’s total population (2). Catholicism
  remains dominant in most of Latin America, and the majority of work on other traditions
  has focused on Protestantism, indigenous religions, spiritism and spiritualism,
  and West African diasporic traditions. But Muslims and their descendants have been
  present in the region since the earliest days of colonization, and the Iberian colonial
  project itself was staged against the backdrop of the Reconquista. Bringing together
  the work of fifteen international scholars, Crescent Over Another Horizon “counteracts
  the widespread assumption that Islam is new or foreign to these Americas” through
  twelve chapters that illustrate the plurality of Islam in Latin America, the Caribbean,
  and the Latina/o United States from the fifteenth century to today (2).
