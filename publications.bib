            This article examines the devotion to souls in São Paulo—a practice that involves lighting candles for and petitioning the souls of the anonymous, suffering dead—by focusing on the particularity of place. To that end, it employs the notion of religious transit (trânsito religioso), used by Brazilian scholars to talk about religious change and movement. But whereas most literature on the subject has focused on switching affiliation, this article explores how affect shapes devotees’ religious transit through urban space. It argues that, in the context of the devotion, mutual suffering underpins a relationship of mutual aid, drawing together the living and departed at places of trauma and death.},

	abstract = {In the sprawling city of São Paulo, a weekly practice known as devotion to souls (devoção às almas) draws devotees to Catholic churches, cemeteries, and other sites associated with tragic or unjust deaths. The living pray and light candles for the souls of the dead, remembering events and circumstances in a rite of collective suffering. Yet contemporary devotion to souls is not confined to Catholic adherents or fixed to specific locations. The practice is also linked to popular tours of haunted sites in the city, and it moves within an urban environment routinely marked by violence and death. While based in Catholic traditions, devotion to souls is as complex and multifaceted as religion itself in Brazil, where African, Portuguese, and other cultural forms have blended and evolved over centuries.Michael Amoruso’s insightful work uses the methods of ethnography, religious studies, and urban studies to consider how devotion to souls embodies, adapts, and challenges conventional ideas of religion as tethered to specific sites and practices. Examining devotees' varied ways of ascribing meaning to their actions, Amoruso argues that devotion to souls acts as a form of what he calls “mnemonic repair,” tying the living to the dead in a struggle against the forces of forgetting.},

	abstract = {Until recently, Islam in Latin America has eluded sustained scholarly attention. This is partly because the Muslim population in Latin America has never been numerically large. Even today, following a century of Middle Eastern migration, Muslims comprise less than half of one percent of the region’s total population (2). Catholicism remains dominant in most of Latin America, and the majority of work on other traditions has focused on Protestantism, indigenous religions, spiritism and spiritualism, and West African diasporic traditions. But Muslims and their descendants have been present in the region since the earliest days of colonization, and the Iberian colonial project itself was staged against the backdrop of the Reconquista. Bringing together the work of fifteen international scholars, Crescent Over Another Horizon “counteracts the widespread assumption that Islam is new or foreign to these Americas” through twelve chapters that illustrate the plurality of Islam in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Latina/o United States from the fifteenth century to today (2).},
